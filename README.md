For this assignement i decided to do a mockup of a portofolio/store for my photography work.

## Website Overview

This website is a mock-up of a future portfolio for my photography work. It showcases the use of bootstrap components to ensure compatibility and for a better layout throughout the site. It also shows use of semantic HTML for better accessibility. 

Added JavaScript functions representing future added features in the page.


Used CSS to make the site more appealing and match the theme I had in mind.



## Bootstrap Components Used


1. **Navbar** – Responsive navigation bar
2. **Cards** – Print sale display with prices and add to cart button
3. **Table** – Print pricing based on size and frame
4. **Carousel** - Showcasing some of my photography



## JavaScript Features



JavaScript features to be added for page functionality.

1. **Email Validation** – Checks is email is valid
2. **Costumer Greeting** - Greets the costumer based on the time of the day
3. **Shoping Cart Total** – Sums the items in the cart by giving the total price.
4. **Inquiry Message** - A simple function that thanks the costumer when they make an inquiry from the form in the contact page.
